== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### I cannot see the loading bar?

If you are logged in to your WordPress-website, the nanobar will load behind your WordPress admin bar. Therefore you cannot see the loading bar. Your visitors will still see it, as will you when you log out or visit your website in a private browsing window. Another option could be that the background colour of your website is the same as the nanobar. You can change the colour of the nanobar via Appearance > WP Nanobar.js.

### How can I change the colour of my loading bar?

You can change the colour via the WP Nanobar.js menu under the "Appearance" menu. Make sure your colour code starts with "#". Example: #fff

### Does WP Nanobar.js work on responsive websites?

Yes it does.

### Will WP Nanobar.js look sharp on retina devices?

Yes it will.
